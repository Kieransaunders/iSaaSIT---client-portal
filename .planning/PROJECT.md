# iSaaSIT

## What This Is

An open-source SaaS starter kit for agencies and freelancers who need a repeatable client project template. Provides multi-tenant foundation where an agency (Org) manages multiple client companies (Customers) with role-based data isolation, billing with usage caps, and a client portal. Built on WorkOS AuthKit + Convex + TanStack Start.

## Core Value

Agencies can spin up new client projects with proper data isolation, billing enforcement, and role-based access without rebuilding auth/tenancy/billing infrastructure each time.

## Requirements

### Validated

- User can sign in via WorkOS AuthKit — existing
- Authenticated routes protected via TanStack Start loader — existing
- Convex backend connected with WorkOS JWT validation — existing

### Active

- [ ] User can create an Organization after signup
- [ ] Org syncs to WorkOS and stores subscription data in Convex
- [ ] Admin can create Customer records within their Org
- [ ] Admin can invite Staff users to the Org
- [ ] Admin can assign Staff to specific Customers
- [ ] Admin or Staff can invite Client users linked to a Customer
- [ ] Staff can only query data for their assigned Customers
- [ ] Client can only query data for their own Customer
- [ ] Admin can upgrade Org via Lemon Squeezy checkout
- [ ] Subscription webhooks update Org caps (maxCustomers, maxStaff, maxClients)
- [ ] System enforces usage caps before creating Customers/Staff/Clients
- [ ] UI uses shadcn/ui component library

### Out of Scope

- AI integrations — can be added as extension later
- Mobile app (React Native) — web-first for v1
- Custom role definitions — hardcoded Admin/Staff/Client only
- Per-Customer billing — Org-level billing only
- Multiple Orgs per user — single Org membership in v1
- OAuth providers beyond WorkOS — WorkOS handles auth providers

## Context

**Base template:** Fork of `get-convex/workos-authkit` (TanStack Start + Convex + WorkOS)

**Original plan evolution:** Started from convex-saas scope doc, pivoted to workos-authkit base. Original plan had Better Auth and Stripe — now using WorkOS AuthKit and Lemon Squeezy.

**Existing codebase includes:**
- TanStack Start with SSR
- WorkOS AuthKit integration (`@workos/authkit-tanstack-react-start`)
- Convex backend with JWT auth config
- Basic route protection (`_authenticated` layout)
- Tailwind 4 setup

**Data model:**
- **Org**: WorkOS manages org + membership; Convex stores subscriptionId, status, planId, caps
- **Customer**: Agency's client company (Convex table, linked to orgId)
- **User**: WorkOS manages; linked to customerId if role = Client
- **StaffCustomerAssignment**: Maps Staff users to Customers they can access

**Role definitions (in WorkOS):**
| Role | Sees | Can Do |
|------|------|--------|
| Admin | All org data | Billing, invites, full access |
| Staff | Assigned Customers only | Standard access within scope |
| Client | Own Customer only | Limited access within scope |

**Billing model:**
- Freemium: Limited free tier, paid plans unlock more
- Billing level: Org (not individual users)
- Provider: Lemon Squeezy
- Caps synced from plan metadata: maxCustomers, maxStaff, maxClients

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Must use existing WorkOS + Convex + TanStack Start foundation
- **Auth provider**: WorkOS AuthKit (not negotiable — already integrated)
- **Billing provider**: Lemon Squeezy (Merchant of Record for global sales)
- **Deployment**: Netlify (primary target)
- **License**: MIT (matching upstream)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| WorkOS over Better Auth | Already integrated in base template, has built-in orgs/roles | — Pending |
| Lemon Squeezy over Stripe | Merchant of Record simplifies global tax/compliance | — Pending |
| TanStack Start over plain Vite | SSR support, better SEO, faster initial load | — Pending |
| Roles in WorkOS not Convex | Single source of truth, WorkOS handles membership | — Pending |
| shadcn/ui for components | Accessible, customizable, works with Tailwind | — Pending |
