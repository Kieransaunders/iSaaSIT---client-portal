- Enforce org onboarding redirect in `src/routes/_authenticated.tsx`
- Clarify restore-user behavior (reinvite vs restore), adjust UI accordingly
- Configure WorkOS webhook endpoint and `WORKOS_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- Configure Lemon Squeezy webhook endpoint and environment variables
- Add CapReachedBanner to invite flow
- Update docs to reflect billing is implemented and required Convex env vars
