# Project State: iSaaSIT

**Last updated:** 2026-02-10

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2025-02-04)

**Core value:** Agencies can spin up client projects with data isolation, billing, and role-based access
**Current focus:** Phase 3 In Progress — Billing + v1 ship blockers

## Current Status

| Phase | Status | Progress |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | ✓ Complete | 100% |
| 2 | In Progress | 4/5 plans |
| 3 | In Progress | 2/5 plans |

**Overall:** 24/32 requirements complete (75%)

## Phase Status

### Phase 1: WorkOS Integration ✓
- **Status:** Complete (2026-02-09)
- **Requirements:** ORG-03 ✓, ORG-04 ✓
- **Verification:** 12/12 must-haves passed
- **Plans:** 01-01 ✓, 01-02 ✓, 01-03 ✓

### Phase 2: Team Management
- **Status:** In progress (4 of 5 plans complete)
- **Requirements:** TEAM-01 ✓, TEAM-02 ✓, TEAM-03 ✓, TEAM-04 ✓, TEAM-05, TEAM-06, ASSIGN-02 ✓, ASSIGN-03 ✓, ASSIGN-04 ✓
- **Plans:** 02-01 ✓ (schema + invitation backend), 02-02 ✓ (staff assignment), 02-03 ✓ (webhook + user management), 02-04 ✓ (team UI)
- **Blockers:** WorkOS webhook must be configured for invitation.accepted to attach users to orgs in Convex

### Phase 3: Billing
- **Status:** In progress (2 of 6 plans complete)
- **Requirements:** BILL-01 to BILL-06
- **Plans:** 03-01 ✓ (webhook + sync), 03-02 ✓ (billing backend)
- **Blockers:** Plan limit mapping must use Lemon Squeezy variant IDs (PLAN_TIERS keys) or billing will default to free limits

- 2026-02-09: Plan 03-01 complete — Lemon Squeezy webhook handler and subscription sync
- 2026-02-09: Plan 02-04 complete — Team management UI with tabbed interface, invite dialog, member/invitation tables
- 2026-02-09: Plan 02-03 complete — WorkOS webhook handler (invitation.accepted) + user management backend (remove/restore/list)
- 2026-02-09: Plan 02-02 complete — Staff assignment mutations/queries + customer detail assignment UI

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

| Decision | Phase | Rationale | Impact |
|----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Include pending invitations in usage counts | 03-02 | Prevents race condition exceeding plan limits | Usage queries count active + pending for staff/clients |
| Build checkout URLs via string construction | 03-02 | Frontend uses Lemon.js overlay, SDK not needed | Simpler implementation, pre-fills org data for webhook |
| Return null for customer portal URL when no subscription | 03-02 | Not an error - user hasn't subscribed yet | UI can gracefully handle null (hide invoice link) |
| Web Crypto API for Lemon Squeezy signature verification | 03-01 | Convex HTTP actions cannot use Node.js crypto module | Pattern for all webhook signature verification in Convex |
| Placeholder variant IDs in plan config | 03-01 | User must create products in Lemon Squeezy dashboard first | Requires manual setup step documented in USER-SETUP.md |
| Cancelled subscriptions keep limits until endsAt | 03-01 | Lemon Squeezy grace period allows access until period ends | UI must show 'Active until [date]' for cancelled subscriptions |
| Store trialEndsAt and endsAt timestamps on org | 03-01 | UI needs to display trial countdown and grace period | Schema extended with optional timestamp fields |
| Client-side tab filtering for team page | 02-04 | Single query, instant tab switching, better UX | May need pagination for orgs with 1000+ users |
| Separate TeamTable and PendingTable components | 02-04 | Different data shapes require distinct components | Pattern for specialized table components |
| Console.error for async errors (not toasts yet) | 02-04 | Toast system not implemented | Replace with toast notifications in future |
| Confirmation dialog only for user removal | 02-04 | User removal more permanent than revoking invitation | AlertDialog before removeUser, not for revoke |
| Manual HMAC webhook verification | 02-03 | Convex HTTP actions can't use "use node" | Web Crypto API for signature verification, pattern for all webhooks |
| Auto-unassign staff on removal | 02-03 | Prevent orphaned assignments | Staff assignments deleted when user removed, not restored on restore |
| Computed status field in user queries | 02-03 | Frontend needs active/removed distinction | listOrgMembers returns status based on deletedAt field |
| Self-removal prevention | 02-03 | Prevent admin lockout | removeUser throws error if targeting self |
| Admin-only assignment UI | 02-02 | Only admins should manage staff assignments per security model | Assignment card hidden from staff and client roles |
| Inline assignment UI on customer detail | 02-02 | Assignments are customer-scoped, most intuitive on customer page | No separate assignment management page needed |
| Prevent duplicate assignments at mutation level | 02-02 | Ensures data integrity, simpler than frontend checks | ConvexError thrown if duplicate assignment attempted |
| Separate internal.ts for queries/mutations in Convex | 02-01 | "use node" files can only contain actions | Pattern for all future WorkOS API integrations |
| Usage caps include pending invitations | 02-01 | Prevent race condition exceeding plan limits | All invitation enforcement checks active + pending counts |
| Client invitations require customerId | 02-01 | Data isolation requires customer assignment | Enforced in sendInvitation action |
| Resend = revoke + send (no native resend) | 02-01 | WorkOS SDK pattern | Standard for invitation lifecycle management |

### Pending Todos
1. Update plan limit mapping in convex/lemonsqueezy/plans.ts to use actual Lemon Squeezy variant IDs (area: billing-config)
2. Enforce admin role on org settings updates (workos.updateOrganization) (area: security)
3. Add role-based access checks to staff assignment queries (prevent staff/client from listing arbitrary assignments) (area: security)
4. Handle customer deletion with client users/invites (block or cascade cleanup) (area: data-integrity)
5. Enforce org onboarding redirect in /_authenticated layout (area: auth-guard)
6. Clarify/implement restore-user behavior (reinvite vs restore), adjust UI accordingly (area: ux)
7. Configure WorkOS webhook endpoint for invitation.accepted events (area: workos-setup) - REQUIRED for invitation acceptance to work end-to-end
8. Configure Lemon Squeezy webhook endpoint and environment variables (area: billing-setup) - REQUIRED for billing operations
9. Add CapReachedBanner to invite flow (area: billing-ux)
10. Update docs to reflect billing is implemented and required Convex env vars (area: docs)
11. Replace agency copy with generic workspace terminology (area: ui)
12. Run v1 smoke test checklist and update requirement statuses (area: verification)

## Next Action

Address ship blockers: fix Lemon Squeezy plan mapping, lock down org settings updates, and add role-based access checks for assignments.
