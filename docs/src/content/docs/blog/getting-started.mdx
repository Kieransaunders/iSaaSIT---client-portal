Welcome to iSaaSIT! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get your first project up and running.

## What is iSaaSIT?

iSaaSIT is an open-source SaaS starter kit designed for agencies and freelancers. It provides:

- **Multi-tenant architecture** - Manage multiple clients from a single platform
- **Built-in authentication** - Enterprise-grade auth with WorkOS AuthKit
- **Role-based access control** - Admin, Staff, and Client roles
- **Real-time database** - Convex powers your backend with live queries

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Node.js 20 or later
- A WorkOS account (free tier available)
- A Convex account (free tier available)

## Quick Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kieransaunders/iSaaSIT.git
cd iSaaSIT
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your WorkOS and Convex credentials.

### 4. Start Development

```bash
npm run dev

## Understanding the Architecture

iSaaSIT uses a hierarchical data model:

1. **Organization** - Your agency
2. **Customers** - Your clients
3. **Users** - People who access the system

Each level has proper data isolation, ensuring clients only see their own data.
